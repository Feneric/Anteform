What Is It?
-----------

Anteform is a weird detective RPG in the style of the older `Ultima games`_ as played on
the Commodore 8-bit computers (although its plot will probably feel a bit more like
the Worlds of Ultima series). Just like the original Ultima games, it includes a world
view, enterable towns, and 3D dungeon displays. It also features graphics, sound
effects, and music that should help one recollect those classics. More importantly,
it is a fully playable (although not yet winnable) game with its own backstory, plot,
setting, and characters.

It was written using the Minima Engine for `PICO-8`_, and can be played online on the
`Anteform at Lexaloffle page`_ and available for download for Linux, macOS,
MS-Windows, and Raspberry Pi through the `Anteform Itch.io page`_.

down from the northwest, a helicopter pad to the southeast, and plains to the south and hills
all around.

retreat from a rat of unusual size (shown directly ahead), but has bumped into a wall. Uh-oh!

What Is It About?
-----------------

Figuring this out is part of the game. You're a detective who's been called to Anteform
Valley to try and locate the missing Steve Johanson. His girlfriend Sally Franklin and
a few of the other townies pooled their resources to hire you, and they convinced the
supply helicopter to drop you off. "Supply helicopter" you ask? Yes, Anteform Valley is
a good distance in the mountains and largely cut off from the world. You won't have any
backup, and you'll quickly discover that this isn't a simple missing persons case.

It's up to you to figure out not just what happened to Steve, but what's going on in
the valley overall. It's up to you to stop it.

It's recommended that you try to get to the main village first. There you'll find both
Sally and the mayor. You start off without any weapons or armor, and this is a very
precarious situation to be in. You'll want to rectify it as quickly as possible. If
you've not done so yet, you should peruse the manual and get some tips about surviving
in Anteform Valley as well as basic information about game controls. If you are too
impatient to skim through the manual, the basic game controls are accessible from
within the pause menu of the game itself. Pressing the `p` key (or the `enter` key on
some platforms) should bring up this menu.

Relationship to Minima
----------------------

This was written using the Minima Engine and was deliberately made to use similar controls
whenever possible. If you are comfortable with one game you'll be comfortable with the
other, too. They aren't set in the same place, though, and while Minima is a large-scale
fantasy game with towns and castles set across a world, Anteform is a weird detective game
of more intimate scale with squares and buildings set across a valley. Anteform has no
magic, but definitely has sci-fi / horror elements that you'll discover on your own as
you progress through the story. It has no spells, but has some special actions that
provide similar (albeit weaker) effects. It has a bit less fighting than Minima, but
more talking, breaking & entering, and searching.

Minima can be downloaded from the `Minima Itch.io page`_ and its source code can be
downloaded from the `Minima GitHub page`_. It can be played online at the
`Minima at Lexaloffle page`_.
