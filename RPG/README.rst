*Traditional Pen, Paper, & Dice RPG Stories Set in Anteform Valley*

What Is This About?
-------------------

The scale of Anteform Valley makes for a good setting for a one-shot or two-shot
role-playing game scenario. In this area one will find scenarios for traditional RPGs
that use the Anteform Valley setting. Each scenario will specify which RPG ruleset
it is designed for as well as the ideal number of players and other parameters needed
by the gamemaster.

While the local setting of Anteform Valley is common with the Anteform CRPG available for
download for Linux, macOS, MS-Windows, and Raspberry Pi through the `Anteform Itch.io page`_,
the actual stories and general worlds in which the valley is set can vary wildly. Traditional
fantasy, urban fantasy, science fantasy, hard sci-fi, gritty contemporary, and straight
horror are just some of the possibilities. Business names may vary from one to the next.
Locations like the Radio KLLR Tower and lab may morph into an observation tower and keep, or
whatever makes sense for the current world. NPCs will most likely be completely different
in the different stories, but may possibly echo some common features. Of course monsters
will vary, too, if the RPG world even has monsters...

More scenarios will be added here as they get developed. Please feel free to contribute your
own.
