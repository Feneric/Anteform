Murder Most Fowl
================

*A short Anteform Valley scenario for 3-5 1st Level D&D 5E characters*

Story Parameters
----------------

A plea from the local sheriff leads you to investigate a threat made to a prominent local
aarakocra in an area settled mostly by humans, and the situation quickly degenerates into
something that 3-5 characters of First Level will be challenged to put right in this story
for `Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition`_ (with `Sandy Petersen's Cthulhu Mythos for 5E`_
being an optional addition).

Who (or what) is responsible for the threat? How many will have to die before you can stop
it? Can you prevent local racist attitudes of the humans toward the aarakocra from making a
bad situation much worse? And just what are those strange things in the forest, anyway?

More contents will be added here as the scenario develops.
